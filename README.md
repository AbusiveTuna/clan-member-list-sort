## Known issues
- Sometimes the member list flickers.
- Constantly sorting the list isn't very performance friendly. I'm looking for ways to improve this.

## Feedback
This is the first time I've worked with Widgets and this is only my second Runelite plugin. This means that there's a lot of room for improvements and optimizations. 
Feel free to open an issue or to contact me on Discord for feedback and suggestions.
