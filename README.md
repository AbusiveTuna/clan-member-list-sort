## Description
Plugin similar to [skilling-notifications](https://github.com/jodelahithit/runelite-plugins/tree/skilling-notifications) that's heavily based on the original Runelite Wintertodt plugin.

The plugin provides visual notifications so the player doesn't forget to start a new action after finishing one or after getting interrupted by a Wintertodt event.
